\title{LexFindR: A package for finding related items and lexical dimensions in a
lexicon.}
\description{
This package implements code to identify lexical competitors in a given list
of words. We include many of the standard competitor types used in spoken
word recognition research, such as functions to find cohorts, neighbors, and
rhymes, amongst many others. The package includes documentation for using a
variety of lexicon files, including those with form codes made up of multiple
letters (i.e., phoneme codes) and also basic orthographies. Importantly, the
code makes use of multiple CPU cores and vectorization when possible, making
it extremely fast and able to handle large lexicons. Additionally, the
package contains documentation for users to easily write new functions,
allowing researchers to examine other relationships within a lexicon.
