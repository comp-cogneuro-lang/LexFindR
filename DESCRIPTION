Description: Implements code to identify lexical competitors in a
   given list of words. We include many of the standard competitor types used 
   in spoken word recognition research, such as functions to find cohorts, 
   neighbors, and rhymes, amongst many others. The package includes 
   documentation for using a variety of lexicon files, including those with 
   form codes made up of multiple letters (i.e., phoneme codes) and also basic
   orthographies. Importantly, the code makes use of multiple CPU cores and
   vectorization when possible, making it extremely fast and able to handle
   large lexicons. Additionally, the package contains documentation for users 
   to easily write new functions, allowing researchers to examine other 
   relationships within a lexicon.
